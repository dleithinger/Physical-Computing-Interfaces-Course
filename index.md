## General Information
### Description
This course introduces the design of physical computing interfaces, through the hands-on development of prototypes that transform their material properties. We will survey the state of the art in shape-changing and haptic interface technologies, and cover their application to Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) and Virtual Reality (VR). Teams of students will ideate and iteratively prototype novel computer interfaces, learning to cohesively blend virtual and physical realities.

### Expectations and Goals
Students who successfully complete this course will:
*	Cover the history and current state of the art of physical computing and transforming computer interfaces, with a focus on tangible interaction and haptic interfaces for VR.
*	Learn how to create immersive and multisensorial media experiences, and how to work effectively across teams.
*	Present and critique interface designs in a studio format, gather user feedback, and learn to iteratively develop user interfaces.
*	Learn sensing and actuation techniques for shape-changing user interfaces.
*	Apply a mix of programming and electronics tools like Unity and Arduino to develop functional prototypes.


### Prerequisites
Students should have either a working knowledge of programming, electronics, or 3D modelling. Additional experience with Unity and Arduino is a bonus.

## Class Content
### Theory: Lectures
Introduction to Tangible Interfaces
